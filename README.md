# SudokuGame by Jake Parker
A little personal Python project to teach me basics of software development and GUI design. 
I have been Sudoku as a brain puzzle for years now, so I thought I was a good place to start 
as I already have an interest in it. Python is also an easy language to learn and is good 
fun. The GUI is all done in Tkinter, which may not be the best option for building a game, but i 
don't mind the challenge of working around its quirks. 

I had already been working on this on and off for a few weeks before putting on git. 

So far it has been a lot of fun and rewarding experience creating something from scratch. Just getting a 
basic solver working and properly understand how to do it recursively was a challenge but a valuable lesson.
I also have an interest in art and graphical design, so the process of designing a user interface has been a lot 
of fun and stimulating. I just feel really good to be able to create something from just an empty file on a computer.
